<center><h3>Installing Elf/OS on RCS Elf Emulator</h3></center>
This document will walk you through the process of installing Elf/OS on the
RCS Elf Emulator.
<h4>Requirements:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Emulator version 2.2 or higher
  <li>Bios rom image
  <li>Elf/OS intall rom image
</ul>

<p><b>1.</b> Start by loading the emulator.  Here is the command line that should
      be used:
<p><tt>./elf -ide -vt100=e2 -elf2 -64k -R bios.rom -R elfos.rom -a -uc</tt>

<p><b>2.</b> Initiate load mode and enter these 3 bytes:
<p><tt>C0 90 00</tt></p>
This initiates a long branch to the installer program.

<p><b>3.</b> Leave load and mode and initiate run mode.  You will then need
      to press &lt;ENTER&gt; once on the vt100 windows to initiate the serial
      connection. at which point you should see this menu:
<pre>
   Elf/Os Installation
   1> Run hard drive init tool
   2> Run filesystem gen tool
   3> Run sys tool
   4> Install binaries
   5> Boot Elf/OS

      Option ?
</pre>

<p><b>4.</b> <b>Note:</b>This step only needs to be performed once.  If you have already
run the hard drive init tool on your emulated drives, you will never need to
run it again.
<p>Run option 1 to initialize the hard drive.  Depending on the speed  of your
computer and the size of the emulated drive this could take from several
minutes to a couple hours to complete.  When the init is complete, you should
see something similar to:
<pre>
   Total Sectors: 53248
   Format Complete
</pre>
and the menu will be redrawn.

<p><b>5.</b><b>Note:</b> This step you also normally need to run only once.
You would only need to run this option agiain if you desire to wipe out the
contents of your drive.
<p>Run option 2 to setup the filesystem on the disk.  After running this step
you should see something similar to:
<pre>
  Total Sectors: 53248
  AU Size: 8
  Total AUs: 6656
  Master Dir Sector: 48
  Filesystem generation complete
</pre>
After which you again get the installation menu.

<p><b>6.</b>Run option 3 to copy the OS kernel to the hard disk.  You should
  see:
<pre>
  System copied.
</pre>

<p><b>7.</b> There is currently a bug in the installer application that I have
not yet tracked down.  Before running option 4 on the main menu take the 
computer out of run mode, enter load mode and re-enter the C0 90 00 bytes and
then back to run mode.  do not forget to press &lt;ENTER&gt; to set the
terminal baud rate.

<p><b>8.</b> Run option 4 to install the binary utilities onto the disk.
<ul>
  <li>DIR - This program allows you to view the disk directory
  <li>DUMP - This program allows you to dump memory contents to executable files
  <li>MINIMON - This program is a simple monitor program that you can use to 
      view/modify memory
  <li>LOAD - This program loads an executable program into memory without
      executing it
  <li>FREE - This program shows you disk usage statistics
  <li>DEL - This program allows you to delete files
  <li>SETBOOT - This program rewrites the boot loader
  <li>HEXDUMP - This program displays the contents of a file in hex
  <li>COPY - This program allows you to copy files
  <li>RENAME - This program allows you to rename files
  <li>TYPE - This program displays the contents of a ascii file
  <li>EDIT - This program is a really simple text editor
  <li>EXEC - This program allows you to execute a program already in memory
  <li>INSTALL - This program allows you to load additional packages
</ul>

<p><b>9.</b>Elf/OS is now installed.  You can sellect option 5 to boot into
Elf/OS.  Note that when booting Elf/OS the data displays will count from 00 to 
0E,  when the displays are 0E, press &lt;ENTER&gt; to set the terminal baud
rate, and then you should see:
<pre>
  Elf/OS Ready
</pre>

From this time on you would enter the bytes C0 FF 00 when you want to boot
Elf/OS.
