<p>This is the first prototype of the Micro/Elf expansion board.  This board 
provides an 8-bit IDE/CF interfce, a Q/EF? (jumper selectable) serial port, a
socket for SRAM/NVRAM/EPROM (jumper selectable), and an expanded version of the
Micro/Elf expansion bus.  This board is shown with a 32k NVRAM that i used when
developing the BIOS for Elf/OS.  This version of the prototype had quirky issues
when writing CF cards and therefore was redesigned.
