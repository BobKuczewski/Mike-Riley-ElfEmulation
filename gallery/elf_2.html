<p>This is one of the 2 prototypes for the Micro/Elf kit.  After building this
board I made 2 modifications to the release version of the Micro/Elf.  first is
that the IN switch was miswired on the prototype, the seconds was that the Q line
did not make it to the expansion connector.
<p>The second prototype board was never built
