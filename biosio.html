<center><h3>Bios Video I/O Module</h3></center>
This module provides a uniform interface to allow seamless use of 1861, 6847,
and serial terminal I/O.  Programs written using this interface can display
on any of these 3 video systems.
<p>Video selection is based upon an initialization routine that scans the 
keyboard and serial line to determine which video mode to use.  If a character
comes first over the serial line, then serial I/O will be used.  If a key
is detected on a port 7 keyboard (Elf II) then 1861 mode is used, If a key
is detected on port 5 (Super Elf) then the 6847 video mode is used.
<p>Many thanks to Richard Peters for building this module!
