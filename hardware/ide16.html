<center><h3>16-Bit IDE/ATA Interface</h3></center>
This circuit provides a 16-bit interface to IDE/ATA devices.

<p>This circuit is utilized by selecting an 8255 port by writing port2 and then
reading/writing the selected 8255 port on port 3.  PB of the 8255 provides
the low 8 bits to the IDE device, while PC provides the high 8 bits.
<p>PA provides the control signals for the IDE bus as follows:
  <table border=1>
    <tr>
      <th>Bit</th>
      <th>Function<th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>IDE Bus A0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>IDE Bus A1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>2</td>
      <td>IDE Bus A2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>3</td>
      <td>IDE Bus CS0 (inverted)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>4</td>
      <td>IDE Bus CS1 (inverted)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>5</td>
      <td>IDE Bus WR (inverted)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>6</td>
      <td>IDE Bus RD (inverted)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>7</td>
      <td>IDE Bus Reset (inverted)</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
The reason for the inversions are because the 8255 will bring bits to 0 during
mode changes.
<p>See the Port Extender schematic to see how Port2, Port3, Inp, and Out are
derived</p>

in either real hardware or simulation</p>
