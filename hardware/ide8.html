<center><h3>8-Bit IDE/ATA Interface</h3></center>
This circuit provides an 8-bit interface to IDE/ATA devices.  This circuit
will only allow half of an IDE hard drive to be utilized, unless the device supports
the 8-bit mode.  CF requires that 8-bit mode be supported. therefore CF cards used
on this interface will utilize the full capabiliities of the card.
<p>This circuit would be utilized by first writing the desired IDE port
number to port 2, and then reading/writing the selected port from port 3.</p>
<p>See the Port Extender schematic to see how Port2, Port3, Inp, and Out are
derived</p>
<p>When using this interface for CF cards I recommend you replace the LS components
with HC components.  Decoupling capacitors may also be needed.
